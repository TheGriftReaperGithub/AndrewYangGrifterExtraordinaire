				The Freedom Dividend.<br><br>

				As Andrew Yang has said on many occasions, even the name of this regressive policy was chosen because of
				how it polled with conservatives. How much more do we really need to know before we come to the
				conclusion that this was designed to be a libertarian Trojan horse? Absolutely nothing.<br><br>

				But what IS a libertarian Trojan horse exactly? It's a government program designed to appear empathetic,
				such as welfare programs with bureaucracies which form a barrier between poor people and money.<br><br>

				But empathetic, it is not.<br><br>

				Andrew Yang's "Freedom" Dividend is meant to destroy the means-tested safety net by allowing people to
				voluntarily opt in to receiving $1000 per month in basic income. To demonstrate how serious this is, let
				me give you an idea of what we're losing by providing some facts about our means-tested safety
				net.<br><br>

				- ONLY 10,000 people died in fiscal year 2017 while trying to get disability benefits.<br><br>

				- The average wait time for said disability benefits is often times ONLY a few years, and the rate at
				which applications are denied is ONLY above 60%.<br><br>

				- 13 million people in poverty are completely disconnected from the safety net. If they choose to have
				their applications for benefits denied, THAT CHOICE SHOULD BE RESPECTED.<br><br>

				- In fiscal year 2018, the average household receiving SNAP got $256 per month. SNAP also has
				restrictions on the food a recipient can buy with it. Putting a $1000 basic income in place threatens
				the existence of this particular program by increasing payout and decreasing restrictions.<br><br>

				- Unlike UBI, welfare has restrictions on income for recipients. If you make too much money, you lose
				your benefits. How are we supposed to help poor people if they aren't poor enough for the safety
				net?<br><br>

				As you can see, Andrew Yang is very dangerous, and the summabitch must be stopped.<br><br>
